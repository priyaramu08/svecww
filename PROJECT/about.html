<h1>We are the Largest Loving society</h1>
<p>Shri vishnu educational Society named after the branding of carving the future of the students.
    Sri Vishnu Educational Society (SVES) is an educational trust run by visionaries right from its inception in 1992. 
    The Founder Late Dr. B. V. Raju was inspired by the concept of setting up quality educational institutions in tier 2 towns. 
    He believed that education could transform lives and set up a women's engineering college in his native town of Bhimavaram,
     West Godavari Dt., Andhra Pradesh that signiﬁcantly transformed the region, especially where it inﬂuenced women towards higher 
     education. He was awarded the Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan awards for his distinguished services and contribution in the field of
      education and cement industry.

    The seeds sown by the Founder Chairman Dr. B. V. Raju, along with the zeal and inspiration by Shri K. V. Vishnu Raju,
     Chairman and grandson of the Founder, have instilled a sense of purpose and commitment to drive the cause of engaging learning 
     for our students in the rural parts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
    
    With 4 sprawling campuses spread across various locations in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana,
     SVES presently has 9 constituent colleges with over 20,000 students offering programs in Engineering, Dental,
      Pharmacy, BSc, MCA, Polytechnic and K-12.With over 1,700 faculty and 20,000 students this unique initiative, 
      the objective is to raise the quality of teaching, learning and ﬁll the gaps in imparting quality technical education to
       both the rural and urban students deﬁning our culture. VEDIC campuses established in Hyderabad and Bangalore, helps us to 
       conduct workshops on the industry relevant skills by eminent resource people from industry and its associated bodies like 
       NASSCOM, CII, TASK, APITA, APSSDC etc.,

      SVES has acquired a name for quality education and positioned itself as the leader in Engineering Institutions with the
       largest women's campus in the State, best of the companies recruiting SVES students in the Campus Placements every year,
        who inturn position themselves as an asset to the organization that recruits them.</p>
